## **SHORT FILM PIPELINE**

This package: "Maya, Mari, Nuke, ZBrush, Hounidi and Adobe" is to build a pipeline for a brand new studio.

It is compatible with Windows 10 (may also work with earlier version but I have not tested yet) and will not work with Maya 2016 or lower.

Regard to VFX Reference Platform, due to large invention we will stay with python 2.7 but will update to python 3 on 2019.
Details is here:

    http://www.vfxplatform.com/

To run it you need to install Python standalone, so I use Anaconda python 2.7 which is very useful.
You can download Anaconda installer here:

    Anaconda python 2.7: https://www.continuum.io/downloads

Right now, most of my work is focusing on developing for Maya, I will work on others in near future.

For Maya plugin required:

    Vray 3.6
